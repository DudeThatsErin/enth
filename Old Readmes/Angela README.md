=============================



Enthusiast (Series 3) is a tool for (fan)listing collective owners to easily
maintain their listing collectives and listings under that collective.

This script is made available for free download, use, and modification as long
as this readme and other notes found throughout the script remains intact and
a link back to http://scripts.indisguise.org/ is given in all sites where the
script is running. It is hoped that the script will be useful, but does not
guarantee that it will solve any problem or is free from errors of any kind.
Users of this script are forbidden to sell or distribute the script in whole
or in part or offer paid installation of this script without written and
explicit permission from me, and users agree to hold me blameless from any
liability directly or indirectly arising from the use of this script.

These terms may be subject to change at any time without prior notice and will
still hold true for any earlier versions of the script and for any user of
any version of the script.




Notes governing the creation and use of modifications
-----------------------------------------------------
Users are free to modify their Enthusiast 3 installations ONLY FOR PERSONAL
USE. This means that NO distribution of the modified Enthusiast 3 is allowed
without explicit written permission from me. If distribution is desired,
all distributions must pass through the official Indisguise Scripts website
(http://scripts.indisguise.org), under the Modifications section, with credits
to the modification creator. Modifications that may be made public through
this manner are only those modifications that will incorporate features that I
do not have any future plans to implement (and have explicitly said so).
Troubleshooting of modified Enthusiast 3 installations fall solely under the
creator of the modification. Additionally, all modifications must still
provide a link back to http://scripts.indisguise.org/.
